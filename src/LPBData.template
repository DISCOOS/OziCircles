        /* Add dropdown-elements using this format:
        mcs[1] = new MissingCategory("Element 1 in dropdown", 40, 300, 1000, 4000, 9000);
        mcs[2] = new MissingCategory("Element 2 in dropdown", 431, 700, 3000, 5000, 11000);
        
        Explanation:
        * The number in "mcs[X]" must be increased for each line
        * The first parameter is a string that will be shown in the dropdown (like "Element 2 in dropdown")
        * The second parameter is an integer, "n". This is the number of persons the stats are based on
        * The third parameter is an integer, "R25". This is the number of meters for 25% in this category
        * The forth parameter is an integer, "R50". This is the number of meters for 50% in this category
        * The fifth parameter is an integer, "R75". This is the number of meters for 75% in this category
        * The sixth parameter is an integer, "R95". This is the number of meters for 95% in this category
        
        Normally, these numbers would come from the "Lost Person Behavior"-book.
        The statistics are copyright by the author of the book, and is not included here in the sourcecode for that reason.
